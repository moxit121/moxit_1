	
	1) C -> Procedural Oriented Programming Language. (POPL)

	    C++ -> POPL and OOPL (Object Oriented Programming Language)

		C++ -> C + Class


	2) C does not support Method overloading

	  C++ suports method overloading.

	3) C contains 32 keywords

	 C++ contains 63/64 keywords.

	



	OOP : (Object Oriented Programming) Language.

	Features or Pillars of OOP.

	There are 4 important features in OOP.

	1) Encapsulation
	2) Inheritance
	3) Polymorphism
	4) Data Abstraction.




	1) Encapsulation : It is a wrapper class in which all data members and member functions
		              are wrapped in a single class.

			example : Capsule.
 

	Class : It is a collection of data-members (variables) and member-functions(functions).

	syntax :

		class class-name
		{
			access-specifier:
				//datamembers;
		};

	Object : It is an instance of a class.

	Why do we create an object?

	- To access the members of the class.

	Lifecycle of an object.

	1) Creation
	2) Utilization
	3) Destruction
	
	e.g papercup 

	
	Access specifiers : It is use for the visibility of the class members.
	
	In C++, there are 3 access specifiers
	
	1) public. : it is accessible within or outside the class.	
	2) private. : it is accessible only within the class.
	3) protected. : it is accessible within the class and to the class which is inheriting it.
	
	- In C++, By default the members inside the class are private
